# Aksana

Aksana is an application that enables users to preview their League of Legends account belongings with others. This application is particularly useful for individuals involved in buying or selling League of Legends accounts, as it allows them to freely browse through the account's details.

### Demo:

<div>
    <a href="https://www.floik.com/embed/e3f6d1d9-e240-4071-af23-1abaa4b0ef6f/85b6d4bf-fbf6-443f-9502-09eb0fbd6e3d-flo.html">
      <img style="width:100%" src="https://i.imgur.com/MsGFiKz.png">
    </a>
  </div>
		
### Aksana consists of three versions:

- **[Aksana Portal](https://github.com/Everkers/Aksana-Portal)**: The front end responsible for rendering the account data.
- **[Aksana Bridge](https://github.com/Everkers/Aksana-Bridge)**: A desktop application used to collect data from the League of Legends local API and transmit it to **Aksana Handler**.
- **[Aksana Hander](https://github.com/Everkers/Aksana-Handler)**: The backend of Aksana. Its main responsibility is to store the user account data in the database for display in the main portal.
